# THE LEDGER

## Canonical Context Document

Version: 4.1

# PROJECT IDENTITY

The Ledger is an operational intelligence, financial normalization, workforce management, document intelligence, and business operations platform designed for:

- Facilities Management
- Cleaning
- Security
- Labour Providers
- Field Services
- Construction
- Maintenance
- Trade Businesses

The Ledger is not accounting software.

The Ledger sits between operations and accounting systems and transforms operational activity into structured, auditable, financially accurate data.

Supported downstream systems include:

- QuickBooks
- Xero
- FreshBooks
- Zoho Books
- Future accounting integrations

---

# CORE DOCTRINE

## Operational Data Is Financial Data

Every financial outcome originates from operational activity.

Operational Event
→ Structured Submission
→ Review Center
→ Approval
→ Financial Normalization
→ Accounting Sync

Nothing becomes financially real until approved.

---

## Approval Doctrine

No operational event may directly create:

- Revenue
- Cost
- Payroll
- Invoice entries
- Inventory deductions
- Accounting mutations

until approved.

Approval is the central control mechanism of the entire platform.

---

## Audit Doctrine

Every financially relevant action must be traceable.

Required audit fields:

- Who
- What
- When
- Previous Value
- New Value
- Source Object
- Destination Object
- External Reference

No silent financial mutations.

---

## Job Mini-Ledger Doctrine

Every Job acts as a mini-ledger.

Jobs own:

- Revenue
- Labor Costs
- Material Costs
- Equipment Costs
- Profitability
- Exposure
- Audit Trail

All financial reporting is job-centric.

---

## Accounting Sync Doctrine

Synchronization exports approved financial truth to downstream accounting systems.

The Ledger remains the source of operational truth.

Sync never creates or modifies financial records.

All sync actions are auditable.

Sync lifecycle:

- Pending → Syncing → Synced
- Pending → Syncing → Failed
- Failed → Retry Required → Syncing → Synced

---

# PRODUCT DEFINITION

## Executive Platform

The Ledger contains:

- Dashboard
- Job Intelligence
- Review Center
- Jobs
- Clients
- Workers
- Schedule
- Map
- Stock
- Assets
- Locations
- Alerts
- Invoices
- Financial Insights
- Roles & Permissions
- Audits
- Automations
- Settings
- API Integrations

## Worker Application

Workers can:

- View assigned jobs
- View schedule
- Start shift timer
- End shift timer
- Submit reports
- Upload photos
- Log issues
- Submit expenses
- View previous submissions

Workers never have financial visibility.

## Client Portal

Clients can:

- View projects
- View assigned crews
- View documents
- View comments
- Submit requests
- View financial summaries
- View invoice status

Client access is provisioned from the main Ledger platform.

# CURRENT DEVELOPMENT MODEL

The current implementation is a high-fidelity frontend prototype.

Purpose:

- Workflow validation
- Financial logic validation
- UX validation
- Approval pipeline validation
- Integration architecture validation

Backend implementation is intentionally deferred.

Current architecture relies heavily on:

- mockData.ts
- Zustand state management
- Mock authentication
- Frontend-only persistence

---

# TECHNOLOGY STACK

## Frontend

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui
- Wouter
- Zustand
- TanStack Query
- React Hook Form
- Zod

## Development

- Git
- GitHub
- PyCharm
- Claude Desktop
- Filesystem MCP
- Playwright MCP

## Future Backend

- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM

---

# ROLE MODEL

## CEO

- Full platform access

## Project Manager

- Access scoped to assigned jobs

## Worker

- Mobile-first workflow
- Reporting access only
- No financial visibility

## Client

- Read-only portal access

---

# REVIEW CENTER DOCTRINE

The Review Center is the core control system of The Ledger.

Submission Types:

- Timesheets
- Inventory Usage
- Equipment Usage
- Expenses
- Reports
- Uploads
- QA Records

Workflow:

Worker Submission
→ Review Center
→ Approve / Reject / Correct
→ Financial Normalization
→ Financial Explorer
→ Accounting Sync

Nothing bypasses Review Center.

---

# FINANCIAL NORMALIZATION ENGINE

Approved operational events become normalized financial records.

Normalization targets include:

- TimesheetEntry
- ExpenseEntry
- InventoryMutation
- EquipmentUsageRecord
- InvoiceLineItem
- FinancialMutation
- PayrollRecords
- RevenueEvents

Normalization is the bridge between operations and finance.

# CLAUDE WORKFLOW DOCTRINE

Claude is used for implementation.

ChatGPT is used for:

- Architecture
- Roadmap management
- Planning
- Auditing
- Prompt generation

Claude is used for:

- Repository inspection
- Implementation
- Testing
- Playwright validation
- Git workflow
- PR creation

Every Claude session must be self-contained.

---

# IMPLEMENTATION RULES

Before implementation Claude must:

1. Read LEDGER_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md
2. Read latest handoff
3. Run git status
4. Run git branch
5. Run git log --oneline -20

Produce:

- Current State
- Proposed Changes
- Implementation Plan

before coding.

---

# GIT RULES

Never commit directly to main.

Always:

- Create feature branch
- Implement
- Test
- Commit
- Push
- Open PR
- Stop

---

# CONTEXT SAFETY RULE

If context limits or execution limits are approaching:

- Commit work
- Push work
- Create handoff
- Stop

Never leave work stranded.

---

# CURRENT PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Phase 5.7 — Next Active Target

Phase 5.6 Accounting Synchronization Layer is complete.

See Phase 5.7 candidates above.

---

# AI AUDIT RULES

Before making recommendations:

1. Read this file completely.
2. Treat this file as the source of truth.
3. Verify repository state before roadmap recommendations.
4. Preserve approval doctrine.
5. Preserve job attribution.
6. Preserve auditability.
7. Preserve financial integrity.
